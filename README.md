## Synopsis

In the heart of a storm-ravaged castle laboratory, Dr. Victor Frankenstein witnesses the impossible: his creation draws its first breath. As lightning tears through the night sky, electricity courses through the creature's assembled body, awakening consciousness where there should be none. In two visceral minutes, we witness the birth of a monster and the terror of its creator—a moment where science transcends morality, and life emerges from death.
